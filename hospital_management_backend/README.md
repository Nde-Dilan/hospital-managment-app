This file contains the implementation of The API code required to interactr with the front end and the Database.
- So it actually works as it git tested and various end points tested work accordingly
- I haven't tested it in the app itself because the pages are not linked to each other thus re-arranging the app will be really long with the time frame I had left.
- So Please Dilan try to rearrange those pages and also establish conection with the pages through various routes
- I think  for now you'll need to have the database locally accessible
- I would've liked that since last friday(The work got complited since then, but I'm sick)

- I f You have any remark of notice a bug in the database or API Functioning share with me
